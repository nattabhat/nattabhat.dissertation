4.5. Propose Strategies based on the Insights and Results
With the current situation of online retailing, retailers are facing crucial factors, such as 
consumer budget, inflation, higher customer expectations, etc., that are challenging their stability 
and sustainability (Perkins, 2023; Finan, 2023). The research objectives aim to understand the 
current experience and preferences of shoppers, which was answered by using descriptive 
analysis in the previous section. Moreover, based on the SEM analysis, the researcher has 
justified another research objective showing that the impact of ‘Recommendation Interaction’ on 
‘Customer Satisfaction’ is significantly positive. However, there is no significant impact of 
‘Review Interaction’ on ‘Customer Satisfaction’.

In response to fulfilling the last dissertation’s objective, the author would like to propose 
valuable strategies based on the obtained results and insights. For small or new e-retailers with 
limited resources in India, the implementation of a recommendation system can be something 
simple and basic, like the built-in features and plugins provided by e-commerce platforms. For 
instance, the Collaborative Filtering (CF) from the Amazon platform (Bouguezzi, 2023). 
According to Chen et al. (2021), one of the current most successful and widely utilized 
recommendation techniques is CF, which can be categorized into user-based and item-based. 
User-based CF focuses on finding similarities between users based on their historical interactions 
or preferences, while item-based CF focuses on finding similarities between items based on how 
users have interacted with them. Meanwhile, hybrid approaches that combine both of them or 
integrate with the other techniques can also improve recommendation quality. The choice of 
technique depends on the recommendation problem, available data, and computational power. 
However, if a retailer wants to rely on its platform and become independent from the giant
retailing sites, the approach of recommendation system is more challenging. The company may 
utilise Shopify or Magento, open-source e-commerce platforms that allow businesses to create 
and manage their online stores. Accordingly, customer data collecting is required to specify their 
product preferences. Following that, the selection of a recommendation algorithm is compulsory 
to align with the platform’s goals and resources. The process might be cumbersome, but a good 
recommendation system is likely to improve customers’ experience and satisfaction. As Jiang et 
al. (2010) mentioned, a good recommendation system comes with a comprehensive understanding 
of customers’ behaviours and services that meet their expectations. Additionally, e-retailers 
should not only enhance the user interface and overall website design but also make sure that the 
transaction process and customer information are safe to provide a seamless and enjoyable 
shopping experience. Ultimately, all retailers should pay close attention to user feedback and 
make rapid improvements to their platforms’ UI.

Regarding customer expectations from the data, shoppers seem to be concerned and not 
fully satisfied with Amazon’s customer responsiveness. Given that, there is a good opportunity 
for micro-retailers to sharpen their edges. Business owners must be able to support and quickly 
solve issues for their customers, and a combination of speed and accuracy is required for a 
support team to generate pleasant customer experiences. Accordingly, having more than one 
support channel is recommended: the use of chatbots to deal with normal issues and trained 
technical staff who can deal with specific problems (Fontanella, 2023). Meanwhile, product or 
service quality assurance and accuracy cannot be neglected. If shoppers are not satisfied with the 
products and their quality mismatches with the advertised ones, e-retailers could experience high 
return rates from their customers. The return of the product is considered a big loss (Finan, 2023);
nevertheless, small retailers can often be more agile in making improvements in this area. 

In addition, there is a significant number of consumers who care and are concerned about 
their impact on the environment. According to Thomann (2023), present customer expectations 
towards environmentally friendly and sustainability from online retailers are increasing. 
Consumers favour sellers who support their values, yet price remains the top consideration. 
Hence, considering eco-friendly packaging options could align with the values of today’s 
shoppers and potentially enhance the brand’s reputation and image. Also, the development of
sustainability regarding profit, people, and the planet is crucial for modern e -commerce. 
Meanwhile, it is undeniable that competitive pricing and product variety are the hot topics of 
customers when it comes to online shopping. Nowadays, numerous platforms offer a wide range 
of product prices and quality, and customers tend to choose the cheapest price with high-quality 
options. Finding better options from other websites is one of the key factors of cart abandonment. 
However, having the lowest price in the market is not a strong strategy for small businesses since 
the juggernaut competitors have more capability to not only lower their operating costs but also a 
wider range of products. Small retailers should focus on putting exclusive value on their products 
or services, making them stand out in the market, and developing a brand’s image based on 
customers’ preferences (Zahorsky, 2022). Truly knowing and understanding what customers 
expect could overcome the abundant resources of the big retailers. Furthermore, for a business to 
be successful, customer loyalty is another crucial element, since retaining old customers is much 
cheaper than acquiring new customers (Flint et al., 2011; Kotler 2010). All retailer owners should 
focus on customer experience, especially pragmatic and emotional experience (Cachero-Martínez
and Vázquez-Casielles, 2021). For instance, telling captivating stories about your brand, product, 
and value and having excellent customer support along with reliable delivery service.

In reality, it is unlikely to satisfy all customers because the preferences and needs of each 
age group are distinctive. The results from the analysis indicate that the predominant online 
shoppers are young adults aged 18-24 and mid-career adults aged 30-39. The current generation 
of online customers seems to be more into Beauty and Personal Care; Clothing and Fashion. 
Accordingly, small businesses should carefully tailor and segment marketing efforts to those 
specific groups who show the most active engagement with the platform. For those newcomer 
e-retailers who have not chosen their area of product or service, it is advisable to consider these 
popular categories. Accounting for gender diversification of customers is also crucial; retailers 
should make sure that their marketing materials and products can reach all genders. This can 
create a more welcoming and inclusive shopping environment. 

Finally, the analysis results also show that there is a considerable number of customers 
who do not browse and shop online regularly. Hence, retailers should consider a combination of 
physical and online stores or an Online-to-Offline (O2O) strategy. A study by Kim et al. (2022)
revealed that having omni-channels, both offline and online, can be a competitive strategy for 
small retailers. The approach provides a combination of convenience and reliability since 
customers can purchase products online and feel them at physical stores. However, it is important 
to carefully select an efficient business model, as some small businesses may lack manpower and 
resources. Inevitably, continuously monitoring customer satisfaction metrics and adapting 
strategies accordingly are not optional. Online retailers should have a reliable customer feedback 
loop to gather insights and suggestions from customers, which can significantly improve their 
operations. Although the process of collecting consumer data might be intricate and tedious, 
valuable and useful insights are ready the be extracted for creating impactful approaches. These 
proposed strategies are in favour of small and newborn e-retailers since they are more agile and 
can quickly adapt to customer changes.
