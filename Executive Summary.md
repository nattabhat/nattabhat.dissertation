Executive Summary

The online retailing industry is experiencing multiple challenges, including rising 
consumer prices, increasing customer expectations, inflation, high return rates, and more. While 
these challenges affect the uncertainty of the future of online retailing, the industry remains 
dynamic and contains opportunities. Given this, it is crucial for e-retailers, especially small and 
new entrants, to prioritise customer satisfaction, deliver unique value, and leverage data-driven 
insights. This study aimed to understand the current state of the online market, focusing on 
general customer experiences and preferences in today’s online shopping world. Additionally, it 
sought to identify the critical factors impacting customer satisfaction in e-retailing. After 
researching previous literature, the author of this study noticed that there was not enough 
knowledge and a noticeable gap regarding the influence of product recommendation system 
interaction with customers (Recommendation Interaction) and product review interaction with 
customers (Review Interaction) on customer satisfaction. Hence, they were proposed as the 
research’s hypotheses. 

The data source for this study was a secondary survey on Amazon’s consumer behaviours, 
as provided by Menon in 2023 on Kaggle. It is important to note that the dataset was created for 
a different purpose, indirectly related to customer satisfaction. To confirm its trustworthiness, the 
study employed reliability and validity tests. The results indicated that the data is appropriate for 
this study, as they fell within acceptable ranges. After that, the study’s first two objectives were 
achieved through a combination of descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM). 
The descriptive analysis revealed that the largest consumer segments and the most active 
engagement with online platforms were adults aged 18-24 and mid-career adults aged 30-39. 
Beauty, personal care, clothing, and fashion emerged as popular product categories. Customers 
appreciated competitive pricing, product recommendation systems, and product variety, while 
also expressing a desire for improvements in product quality, accuracy, and customer service 
responsiveness. The SEM results confirmed a statistically strong impact of ‘Recommendation 
Interaction’ on ‘Customer Satisfaction’, while ‘Review Interaction’ showed a non-significant 
impact. This suggests that online retailers should invest in and tailor recommendation systems to 
enhance customer satisfaction. The results and insights from the first two objectives have become 
a strong foundation for the study’s third objective, which is to propose counteract strategies for 
small retailers to sharpen their competitive edges and avoid mistakes made by Amazon.

Subsequently, to address the needs of small and emerging e-retailers, counter strategies 
were proposed as the third objective of the study. These strategies encompass various aspects of 
e-commerce, from recommendation systems and customer support to product quality assurance 
and eco-friendly packaging. Competitive pricing, product variety, and the addition of unique 
value to services were emphasised. Targeted marketing efforts, including gender diversification
and offline-to-online (O2O) strategies, were recommended. It is important to note that the study’s 
findings and proposed strategies are specific to Indian online retailers, as the survey was 
conducted in India. Inevitably, continuous monitoring of customer satisfaction and feedback 
collection is necessary for adapting strategies in response to evolving customer preferences and 
market dynamics. The practicable proposed strategies aim to help small retail businesses survive 
and be able to compete with big retailers in such a competitive market, which is the ultimate goal 
of this dissertation.
